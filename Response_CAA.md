To work closer with the community of Drone user in the consultation on...

In particular to provide drone uses with 

1. Evidence of non-compliance.
2. Risk based approach on safety based upon evidence and real data not opinions. 

3. Carefully consider imposing further technical restriction such as remote ID. As this could lead to more user to 'hack' their drone.  This will reduce the peer pressure to comply with the current regulations from with the drone community. An unintended consequence will increase the non-compliance and security risk.

(General Options on Section 2 are:-

* Definitely agree 
* Somewhat agree 
* Neither agree nor disagree 
* Somewhat disagree 
* Definitely disagree 
* I do not know )


1. Do you agree with the challenges with operational requirements identified by stakeholders, and why? 

* Definitely disagree 

 Please provide detail on why you have selected your answer: 
 
Operational requirements
They are not complex or challenging many guide exist online for users, who wish to comply to understand operational requirements

Risks are adequate mitigated. To (ALARP) as low as reasonably practicable. The exists not incident or evidence to suggest the the current mitigate are not adequate. The  number of killed or seriously injured and minor injury is zero. 

Restrictions for UAS manufactured before 2026 are not burdensome. There is not evidence presented to support this statement. Many guide exist online for users

2. Should CAA adopt the following policy objectives for operational requirements and why? 

Mitigate safety and security risks - Definitely No.
User-centric - Definitely yes.
Enforceable  - yes to an extent.
Growth enabling  - yes to an extent.
Scalable  - yes to an extent.

The mitigation of safety and security risks implies that you believe the current regulation is failing in this respect - there is no evidence to presented. 

 3. Do you value international alignment in operational requirements, and why? 
- Definitely yes 
 
Yes. It stops UK supplier being under-cut by the race to the bottom.


4. Should CAA re-name operational categories and sub-categories (Opportunity 1) and why? 
 Yes, to an extent
 
Naming is superficial but they could be more meaningful.

5. Should CAA simplify how operational requirements are categorised (Opportunity 2) and why? 

 Definitely No 

The CAA has not given risk based approach on evidence therefore the approach to simplification is ill-defined. 

No evidence is provided on which risk are being mitigated. There are clearly different risk for flight over people, far away and in countryside. 


6. Should CAA update how model aircraft operations are regulated (Opportunity 3) and why? 

Neither yes or now


7. Should CAA simplify exclusions from operational requirements (Opportunity 4) and why? Please describe any alternative exclusions that should be considered. 

Definitely No

250g is a proportionate approach there is little proven evidence of entering restricted airspace. 

250g is a proportionate approach for protecting unlawfully collection of
personal and sensitive data. 250g is far less than the capabilities of any modern mobile phone, which remain unregulated. 

To increase levels of compliance options could be given or low-mass FPV without a spotter present of less than 100g.

8 Should CAA change transitional arrangements for users of UAS without class-marks (Opportunity 5) and why?

Yes to an extent

No evidence to suggest current drones are unsafe. Arrangements could be made to permit C-1 labelled drones to have the same freedoms enjoyed in Europe.

9 Do you agree with the issues identified by stakeholders relating to product requirements, and why?

Definitely disagree
 
Disagree that regulatory requirements are not as effective as they could be in mitigating safety and security risks. No evidence of any safety issues. 

More restrictive regulation will drive users to circumvent technical blocks. Similar to electric bikes.  This will also driver users to not use UK suppliers. 

10 Should CAA adopt the following policy objectives for product requirements, and why?

Mitigates safety and security risks - Definitely no 
User-centric - Definitely yes 
Growth enabling - Definitely yes
Scalable  - Definitely yes
Internationally aligned  - Neither yes nor no 

Make more use of geo-restrictions as a mitigation measure.

 11. Should CAA implement manufacturer standards (Opportunity 8) and why? 
 
Neither yes nor no 
 
The danger is that this makes UK suppliers uncompetitive. 
 
12 Should CAA implement a product labelling scheme (Opportunity 9) and why?
Definitely no

Why is this necessary beyond the class marking? The class mark should tell you all you need to know. Use existing EASA based numeric C0-C4 labels.


13. Should CAA simplify exclusions from product requirements (Opportunity 10) and why? 

Definitely no

Remote ID and geo-awareness, to UAS below 250g with cameras  will lead to more users circumventing Remote ID. This will reduce the peer pressure to comply with the current regulations from with the drone community. An unintended consequence will increase the non-compliance and security risk. 

 14. Should CAA implement Remote ID (Opportunity 11) and why? 

Definitely no


Remote ID for UAS below 250g with cameras will lead to more user circumventing Remote ID. This will reduce the peer pressure to comply with the current regulations from with the drone community. An unintended consequence will increase the non-compliance and security risk. 

Remote ID does not improve safety. 

It is beyond the scope of the CAA. Over-reach to harvest data. 

When rules lose the support of the masses they get ignored by the masses. 

Criminals will not register. 

 15. Should CAA to implement geo-awareness (Opportunity 12) and why? 

Neither agree nor disagree

Remote ID and geo-awareness, to UAS below 250g with cameras  will lead to more user circumventing Remote ID. This will reduce the peer pressure to comply with the current regulations from with the drone community. An unintended consequence will increase the non-compliance and security risk. 

16 Should CAA introduce requirements for manufacturers to provide user guidance during product set-up or pre-flight, via the controller or
other interface (Opportunity 13) and why?

Definitely yes
 
 A sensible checklist as per pilot of other aircraft. 
 
 17 Should CAA introduce user validation requirements on manufacturers (Opportunity 14) and why?
 
No, to an extent 
  
It may led to UK supplier being under-cut by the race to the bottom.


18. Should CAA simplify policy and guidance document structure (Opportunity 15) and why? 

 Yes, to an extent 
 
 
19 What other opportunities to improve UAS regulation, beyond those described in this Call for Input, would you like to see progressed?

To being more people within the regulatory framework I like to see a way to fly FPV, for a low mass drone, at a short distance without a spotter. 

Bring in lower height restrictions to let smaller drones, low mass drones fly in more places.
