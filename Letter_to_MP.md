Dear {MP NAME},  

I am writing to you today because I am concerned about the  Civil Aviation Authority Call for Input: Review of UK UAS Regulations CAP 2569. As I am a daily Unmanned Aviation Systems (UAS), otherwise known as a drone user - I am concerned the consultation will not take into account view of drone users. 

I am asking you to raise with the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State (Aviation, Maritime and Security) key concerns. To work closer with the community of Drone users in the consultation and in particular to provide:-

1. Evidence of non-compliance of the current regulations which led to any harm of people Killed or Seriously Injured, or injuries or dangerous occurrences. 
2. Clear reasoning on why remote ID is being considered. 
3. The Minister's approach for ensuring any revision to the regulations has the support of the 289,000 UAS (drone) users. 

Carefully consideration needs to be given on imposing further technical restrictions such as remote ID, as this could lead to more users to 'hack' their drone.  This will reduce the peer pressure to comply with the current regulations from within the drone community. An unintended consequence will be to increase the non-compliance of all regulations. When rules lose the support of the masses they get ignored by the masses. 

I would like to request that you escalate my letter to Parliamentary Under Secretary of State (Aviation, Maritime and Security) to ensure the consultation is real and works with over 289 thousand drone users in the UK which hold valid up to date flyerID - whose license fees money supports the CAA. 

Please do keep me informed of any progress made.  

Yours faithfully,
