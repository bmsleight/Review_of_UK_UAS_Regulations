Dear {MP NAME},  

My names is {YOUR NAME} and I am a constituent of {OUR CONSTITUENCY}. I am writing to you today because I am concerned about the  Civil Aviation Authority Call for Input: Review of UK UAS Regulations CAP 2569. As I am a daily UAS, otherwise known as a drone user - I am concerned the consultation will not take into account view of drone users. 

I am asking you to raise with the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State (Aviation, Maritime and Security) key concerns. To work closer with the community of Drone user in the consultation in particular to provide drones uses with:-

1. Evidence of non-compliance of the current regulations 
2. Risk based approach on safety based upon evidence and real data not opinions. 
3. Carefully consider imposing further technical restriction such as remote ID. As this could lead to more user to 'hack' their drone.  This will reduce the peer pressure to comply with the current regulations from with the drone community. An unintended consequence will increase the non-compliance and security risk.

I would like to request that you escalate my letter to Parliamentary Under Secretary of State (Aviation, Maritime and Security) to ensure the consultation is real and works with over 289 thousand drone users in the UK which hold valid up to date flyerID.

Please do keep me informed of any progress made.  

I look forward to hearing from you.  

Yours faithfully,  

{YOUR NAME}
